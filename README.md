## Introduction
This is a pet project of mine. 

Started out as an excercise for basic html elements, css and github usage, one of the first excercises during the curriculum. 
But cooking also happens to be my passion, so I decided to apply the things I learn during the curriculum not only on the planned excercises but this project as well.

Later I plan to expand it's functions, as of now I still have a lot to learn, but already have some ideas for more pages and a long list of recipes to jot down.
