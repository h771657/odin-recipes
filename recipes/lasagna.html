    <h2>Every monday hating cats favorite dish</h2>
    <p>Lasagna, the so-called "classic" Italian dish that everyone pretends to love. 
        It's basically just layers of pasta, meat sauce, and cheese thrown together.         Sure, the Italians claim they perfected it, but let's be real, it's just
      a glorified pasta bake. The meat sauce is usually a mix of ground beef or 
      pork, tomatoes, onions, and garlic – nothing groundbreaking. And don't get me 
      started on the béchamel sauce, which is just butter, flour, and milk. Wow, so
       fancy. Top it with some mozzarella and Parmesan, and you've got yourself a
     dish that everyone will pretend to enjoy. Serve with a side salad and garlic 
     bread if you want to be extra basic.</p>
