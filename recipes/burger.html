    <h2>It's just a sandwich, deal with it</h2>
    <p>The hamburger, a quintessential American dish, has its origins in the city of Hamburg, Germany. 
        In the late 19th century, German immigrants brought the concept of the Hamburg steak to the United States. 
        This dish consisted of a seasoned, minced beef patty, which was typically served without a bun. Over time, 
        the Hamburg steak evolved into what we now know as the hamburger. The addition of a bun, along with 
        various toppings such as lettuce, tomato, cheese, and condiments, transformed the simple beef patty into 
        a versatile and beloved meal. The hamburger gained widespread popularity in the early 20th century, 
        particularly with the rise of fast food restaurants. Today, it is enjoyed by millions of people around 
        the world and remains a symbol of American cuisine and culture.</p>
